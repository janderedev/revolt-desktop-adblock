# Revolt Desktop App with built-in ad blocker

This fork of [revoltchat/desktop](https://github.com/revoltchat/desktop) bundles the [Cliqz AdBlocker](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/adblocker), which prevents YouTube and other sites embedded in link previews from serving ads and trackers.

I also tried to bundle [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock), but it did not work due to missing extension APIs in Electron.
